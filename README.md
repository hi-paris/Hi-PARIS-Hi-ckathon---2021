# Hi!PARIS Hi!ckathon - 2021 

### Foreword

During the weekend from March 12th till March 14th took place the first edition of the Hi!ckathon organized by the Hi!PARIS center, gathering students from all schools of Institut Polytechnique de Paris as well as HEC to compete against each other.

This repo centralizes all the algorithmic content produced in the context of the Hi!cakthon. You will find two main folders

* **Technical Challenge Description** : This folder contains a thorough description of the technical problem as well as context, instructions and explanations of the tools necessary to solve the problem at hand

* **Student Teams Solutions** : This folder encompasses all the implementations of the technical approaches designed by student teams. Each subfolder corresponds to a given team's work and will contain a **jupyter notebook named team_X_solution.ipynb in which the final code is used**

### Please Note

* While the competition featured both business-oriented and technical tasks, only the technical solutions can be found in this repo.
